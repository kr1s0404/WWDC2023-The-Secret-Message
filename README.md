## The Secret Message

My app, the secret message, is a small game built on the "three-pass protocol", which is a cryptographic transmission protocol. During my studies in Computer Science at university, I often encountered new technical terms and computer theories in lectures. However, most of the time, these concepts were presented in written form, and I found it difficult to quickly comprehend the content. As a result, I believed that presenting the workings of these computer theories in the form of a game would assist students in their learning. Thus, I chose the famous theory of the "three-pass protocol" in cryptography as the background of my game, enabling users to gain an understanding of how this protocol operates through playing the game.

The entire app is crafted using Apple's new framework, "SwiftUI". When I first began my journey in iOS development two years ago, SwiftUI had already been launched, and thus, I have been using the SwiftUI framework ever since. The remarkable ease of use, brevity, and declarative style of SwiftUI has provided me with a friendly experience since I first entered the realm of iOS development. Within the app, I have included a drawing feature that replaces the traditional text input method, enabling users to communicate not only through text but also through images.
